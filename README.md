# PhD-Thesis
This is my PhD thesis along with supplementary files. This thesis comprises four papers in criminality in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Three of them are written in Brazilian portuguese and one of them in English.

It was made using RSweave features which compiles with RStudio, since it has R codes along with Latex code. In addition, this repository has a .tex file which is automated generated when compiling a RSweave file (.Rnw) in RStudio and the presentation which was made using RMarkdown (.Rmd). During the compilation process of the thesis in RSweave, all the figures files made in R are generated to compile the final pdf.

The main file is "TESE_DE_DOUTORADO_RENAN_FINAL.Rnw" and the final version of the thesis is "TESE_DE_DOUTORADO_RENAN_FINAL.pdf".
